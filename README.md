This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to specificity and the cascading nature of stylesheets. The bug showcases how seemingly higher-specificity selectors might be overridden by later rules due to the order of rules. The solution explains how to fix it by adjusting the order or using the `!important` flag (although it is not always recommended).
